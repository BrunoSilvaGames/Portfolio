# Portfolio

*A collection of gameplay mechanics by Bruno Silva.*

## Introduction

This portfolio is a collection of various gameplay mechanics that I developed for my projects over the past 5 years. During this time, I mainly focused on developing a cooperative third-person shooter that featured a dynamic urban environment. The **Procedural City Plan Generator** and the **Gameplay Ability System Inventory** are both implementations that I developed for this project. Recently, I also experimented with orbital simulations for a space-themed project and created the **Kepler Orbit Simulation** for that purpose.

I'm in the process of gathering several of the different features that I've worked on that are mature enough to display here. Currently, this project only contains the source code for some features and is not what I would consider complete. This project will most likely be updated several times and I plan on adding gameplay samples to show off each of the features.

## Procedural City Plan Generator

The **Procedural City Plan Generator** dynamically creates a city plan for a user-defined space, in a non-uniform grid style. 

## Gameplay Ability System Inventory

The **GAS Inventory** extends the functionality of the *Gameplay Ability System* developed by Epic by integrating it with an item and equipment system.

## Kepler Orbit Simulation

The **Kepler Orbit Simulation** can be used to create orbital systems with planets, moons and asteroids in an easy and realistic way.
